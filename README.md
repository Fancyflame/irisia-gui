## Take a quick look

A simple window application is looks like following. Newest examples please take a look at
[examples](https://github.com/Fancyflame/cream-rs/tree/main/examples) directory.

```rust,ignore
#[cream::main]
async fn main() {
    cream::new::<App>("test".into()).await.unwrap().join().await;
